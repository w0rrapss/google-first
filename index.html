                It might be true, however, in reality it does <span class="more_attention">not</span> work like this.
                Only because of the work we evaluated

            <p>
                You will <span class="more_attention">not</span> gain any experience by just asking someone. You always

            <p>
                It depends on your question how quickly someone will help you.
                Follow this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Strictly ask what do you want. It's always much easier to answer when you know what is the
                    problem.</p></li>
                <li><p>Clean your question as much as possible. Provide as much information as possible. Don't just
                    leave your question alone without any explanations.</p></li>
                <li><p>It's always useful to mention what did you already do trying to fix the issue. Nor you, nor
                    others will not then waste time for nothing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check your question for typo mistakes. Most messengers will underline the common orthography
                    mistakes. Sometimes, such mistakes may be critical in, for example, terminology, when you mean one
                    thing, however saying literally something different, making the situation not possible to
                    understand. <span class="more_attention">You are always allowed to use translators!</span></p></li>
                <li><p>Imagine a service kicked out an error. Firstly, analyse it and then copy only the important part,
                    unless you feel that the whole error might be useful. Always try to be that one "pro" guy and think
                    which information would help them to understand your problem.</p></li>
